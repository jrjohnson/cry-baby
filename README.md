The purpose of this library is to ping random URLs in order to obfuscate your browser traffic.  This won't hide
you from advertisers, but it should significantly obscure your real browsing so as to make any data logged by your
ISP worthless.

## Disclaimer:
I have no idea if this works yet and need to validate the approach with smarter people.  Use it if you want,
but right now this is an unproven and possibly bad idea.

### todo:
- Expand the list of URLs to hit
- Make URL subsets configurable
- Create a binary which can run in the background
